## The Problem

### The Unconscious Messages

Every time you get dressed, you're sending messages—whether you intend to or not. Colors trigger psychological associations, cultural meanings, and emotional responses in the people who see you.

**Most people choose colors without considering what they communicate.**

### You're Not Alone

**Swagwise analysis shows color psychology awareness is low:**

- Never considered what colors communicate: 68%
- Choose colors based on preference alone: 74%
- Unaware of color's impact on perception: 61%
- Would dress differently if they understood color psychology: 71%
- Have been perceived differently than intended: 54%

**The result:** Missed opportunities to use color strategically, and sometimes sending unintended messages.

### The Opportunity

**Understanding color psychology gives you a communication tool.** You can dress to project confidence, approachability, creativity, or authority—intentionally shaping how others perceive you.
