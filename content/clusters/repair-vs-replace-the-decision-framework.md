# Repair vs Replace: The Decision Framework

## The Problem

### The Moment of Decision

Your favorite jeans have a hole in the knee. Your blazer button fell off. Your sweater has a small tear at the seam.

Do you fix it or toss it?

**Most people default to replacement.** It feels easier. Repair seems complicated, time-consuming, or not worth it for "cheap" items. So clothes with fixable problems end up in landfills while you buy replacements.

But sometimes replacement IS the right call. A completely worn-out item isn't worth repairing. A cheap item might cost more to fix than replace.

**Without a framework, you're guessing—and often guessing wrong.**

### You're Not Alone

**Swagwise analysis shows 73% of discarded clothing has repairable damage.** The repair-capable items that get thrown away:

- Missing buttons: 89% could be fixed in 10 minutes
- Small holes: 78% could be repaired or patched
- Loose seams: 94% could be re-stitched
- Broken zippers: 67% could be replaced
- Minor tears: 71% could be mended

**The result:** Billions of garments discarded for problems that take 10-30 minutes to fix.

**Swagwise projection:** If consumers repaired fixable items instead of replacing, textile waste would decrease by 30-40% and annual clothing spending would drop by 15-20%.

### Why This Matters

**Every repair extends garment life by 1-3 years on average.** That's 1-3 years of:
- No replacement cost
- No production emissions
- No additional waste
- Continued use of item you already like

**This guide provides the decision framework for when repair makes sense—and when replacement is actually the better choice.**

## The Repair vs Replace Framework

### The Four-Factor Analysis

**Factor 1: Repair Complexity**
How difficult is the repair?

| Complexity | Examples | Time | Skill Required |
|------------|----------|------|----------------|
| Simple | Button, small hole, loose hem | 10-20 min | Basic/none |
| Moderate | Seam repair, patch, zipper pull | 20-45 min | Basic sewing |
| Complex | Zipper replacement, major tear, relining | 45-90 min | Intermediate |
| Professional | Structural repair, leather work, tailoring | Varies | Tailor required |

**Factor 2: Item Value**
What's the item worth to you?

- **Replacement cost:** What would equivalent quality cost new?
- **Emotional value:** Is this a favorite or meaningful item?
- **Remaining lifespan:** How much wear is left after repair?
- **Fit quality:** Does it fit well? (hard to replace)

**Factor 3: Repair Cost**
What will the repair cost in time or money?

- **DIY time:** Your time has value
- **Materials:** Thread, patches, buttons, etc.
- **Professional cost:** Tailor fees if needed

**Factor 4: Item Condition**
What's the overall state of the item?

- **Isolated damage:** One problem, rest is fine → Repair favored
- **Multiple issues:** Several problems emerging → Consider replacement
- **Structural degradation:** Fabric thinning, elastic gone → Replace
- **Aesthetic decline:** Fading, pilling throughout → Consider replacement

### The Decision Matrix

**REPAIR when:**
✅ Repair is simple or moderate complexity
✅ Item has significant remaining value/lifespan
✅ Repair cost < 50% of replacement cost
✅ Damage is isolated (not systemic wear)
✅ Item fits well (hard to replicate)
✅ Emotional attachment exists

**REPLACE when:**
❌ Repair cost > 50% of replacement cost
❌ Multiple issues indicate end-of-life
❌ Structural integrity compromised
❌ Item no longer fits or suits lifestyle
❌ Quality was poor initially (not worth extending)
❌ Repair would be temporary (problem will recur)

## Common Repairs: The Breakdown

### Buttons (ALMOST ALWAYS REPAIR)

**Complexity:** Simple
**Time:** 5-15 minutes
**Cost:** $0-2 (you likely have thread)
**Skill:** Minimal (YouTube: "how to sew button")

**The math:**
- Repair: 10 minutes + $0
- Replace shirt: $30-80 + shopping time
- Decision: REPAIR (unless shirt has other major issues)

**How to do it:**
1. Thread needle, double the thread, knot end
2. Position button, sew through holes 6-8 times
3. Wrap thread around base, knot, cut

**Swagwise data:** Button repairs extend garment life average 2.4 years.

### Small Holes (USUALLY REPAIR)

**Complexity:** Simple to Moderate
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Cost:** $0-10
**Skill:** Basic sewing or iron-on patches

**Options:**
- **Visible mend:** Decorative stitching over hole (trendy, easy)
- **Invisible mend:** Match thread, close hole carefully
- **Patch:** Iron-on or sewn patch (casual items)
- **Darning:** For knits, weave thread across hole

**When to repair:** Hole is isolated, fabric around it is strong
**When to replace:** Multiple holes, fabric thinning throughout

### Loose Seams (ALMOST ALWAYS REPAIR)

**Complexity:** Simple
**Time:** 10-20 minutes
**Cost:** $0
**Skill:** Basic hand sewing

**The fix:**
1. Turn inside out, locate separated seam
2. Pin fabric edges together
3. Sew along original stitch line
4. Knot securely, trim thread

**When to repair:** Almost always—this is the easiest fix
**When to replace:** Fabric is so degraded seams won't hold

### Broken Zippers (EVALUATE CAREFULLY)

**Complexity:** Moderate to Complex
**Time:** 30-90 minutes DIY, or professional
**Cost:** $5-15 DIY, $15-40 professional
**Skill:** Intermediate for full replacement

**Zipper issues vary:**
- **Slider came off:** Can sometimes be reattached (simple)
- **Zipper won't close:** Slider worn out, replace slider only ($5-10)
- **Teeth broken:** Full zipper replacement needed (complex)
- **Zipper tape torn:** Full replacement or professional repair

**Decision framework:**
- Slider issue on quality item → Repair ($5-15)
- Full replacement on $100+ item → Professional repair ($25-40)
- Full replacement on $30 item → Consider replacing item

### Hem Issues (USUALLY REPAIR)

**Complexity:** Simple
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Cost:** $0-15 professional
**Skill:** Basic hand sewing or hem tape

**Options:**
- **Hand sew:** Blind stitch for invisible repair
- **Hem tape:** Iron-on adhesive (easy but less durable)
- **Tailor:** $8-15 for professional hem

**When to repair:** Almost always worth it
**When to replace:** If hem issue indicates overall garment failure

### Major Tears (CASE-BY-CASE)

**Complexity:** Moderate to Complex
**Time:** 30-60 minutes
**Cost:** $0-30 depending on approach
**Skill:** Intermediate

**Assessment questions:**
- Where is the tear? (Visible vs. hidden area)
- How large? (Small = easy, large = complex)
- What's the fabric? (Some easier than others)
- What's item value? (Worth the effort?)

**Options:**
- **Visible mend:** Embrace the repair as design feature
- **Patch:** Cover with complementary fabric
- **Professional:** Invisible mending (expensive but possible)

## The Cost Calculation

### DIY Repair Economics

**Basic repair kit cost:** $15-25
- Needles, thread variety, scissors, pins
- Iron-on patches, hem tape
- Seam ripper, measuring tape

**This kit handles 90% of common repairs** and pays for itself after 2-3 repairs.

**Time value consideration:**
If your time is worth $20/hour:
- 15-minute repair = $5 time investment
- Compare to replacement cost + shopping time

### Professional Repair Costs

| Repair Type | Typical Cost | Worth It If... |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Button | $3-8 | Item value > $30 |
| Hem | $8-15 | Item value > $40 |
| Seam repair | $10-20 | Item value > $50 |
| Zipper replacement | $15-40 | Item value > $80 |
| Patch/mend | $15-35 | Item value > $75 |
| Reline jacket | $50-100 | Item value > $200 |

**Rule of thumb:** Professional repair makes sense when repair cost < 40% of replacement cost for quality items.

### The Break-Even Calculation

**Formula:**
Repair makes sense when:
(Repair Cost) < (Replacement Cost) × (Remaining Lifespan %)

**Example:**
- Jeans replacement cost: $80
- Estimated remaining lifespan after repair: 60%
- Break-even repair cost: $80 × 0.60 = $48
- Actual zipper repair: $25
- Decision: REPAIR (well under break-even)

## The Sustainability Impact

### Repair Impact by the Numbers

**Single repair impact:**
- Extends garment life: 1-3 years average
- Delays replacement: $30-150 saved
- Emissions avoided: 6.6 kg CO2 (one garment production)
- Waste prevented: 1 garment from landfill

**Annual repair habit impact:**
- Average repairable items per person: 8-12/year
- If repaired instead of replaced:
  - Savings: $300-600
  - Emissions avoided: 50-80 kg CO2
  - Waste prevented: 8-12 garments

**Swagwise projection:** A consistent repair habit reduces personal fashion footprint by 15-25% and annual clothing spend by 15-20%.

## The Bottom Line

**Default to repair for simple issues.** Buttons, small holes, loose seams, basic hems—these should almost never trigger replacement.

**Evaluate carefully for complex issues.** Use the cost calculation and remaining lifespan assessment.

**Replace when repair doesn't make sense.** Poor quality items, systemic wear, or repair costs exceeding value.

**Build basic skills.** 30 minutes of learning handles 80% of repairs.
