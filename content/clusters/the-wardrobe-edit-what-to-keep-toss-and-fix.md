# The Wardrobe Edit: What to Keep, Toss, and Fix

Your closet is full. Your options feel empty.

That's the paradox of an unedited wardrobe: the more you own, the less you feel like you have to wear.

The solution isn't shopping. It's editing.

A proper wardrobe edit transforms a chaotic closet into a functional one. You remove what doesn't serve you, keep what does, and end up with fewer pieces that create more outfits.

This guide walks you through the entire process—what to keep, what to let go, and what's worth saving.

## Why Editing Matters

### The Problem With Full Closets

An overstuffed closet creates:

**Decision overload:** Too many options paralyze you.
**Visual chaos:** You can't see what you have.
**Guilt:** Unworn pieces remind you of wasted money.
**Time waste:** Searching through clutter takes time.
**Poor outfit choices:** Great pieces get buried under mediocre ones.

### The Power of Editing

An edited closet creates:

**Clarity:** You see exactly what you own.
**Speed:** Getting dressed takes minutes.
**Confidence:** Everything in there works.
**Space:** Pieces can breathe; you can see them.
**Quality focus:** Only your best pieces remain.

### The Math

If you own 100 pieces but only wear 30, you have a 30-piece wardrobe surrounded by 70 pieces of visual noise.

Remove the 70. Keep the 30. Your wardrobe becomes more functional, not less.

## Before You Start

### Set Aside Time

A proper edit takes 2-4 hours. Don't rush it.

Schedule a block of time—a weekend morning, an evening, whenever you can focus.

### Gather Supplies

- Full-length mirror
- Good lighting
- Garbage bags or boxes (for donate, sell, toss)
- Notebook (to track gaps)
- Phone (to photograph keepers)
- Hangers (to reorganize)

### Get in the Right Mindset

This isn't about deprivation. It's about liberation.

You're not losing clothes. You're gaining a functional wardrobe.

Every piece you remove makes room for the pieces you love.

## The Keep, Toss, Fix Framework

Every piece goes into one of five categories:

### Category 1: KEEP (Love and Wear)

**Criteria:**
- Fits well right now
- You feel good wearing it
- You've worn it in the past year (or season-appropriate equivalent)
- It coordinates with multiple other pieces
- It's in good condition

**Action:** Return to closet in an organized way.

### Category 2: DONATE/SELL (Good Condition, Not for You)

**Criteria:**
- Good condition
- Doesn't fit, flatter, or suit your life
- Someone else would love it
- You haven't worn it in 12+ months

**Action:** Box up immediately for donation or sale.

### Category 3: TOSS (Beyond Saving)

**Criteria:**
- Stained, torn, or damaged beyond repair
- Worn out (stretched, faded, pilled beyond fixing)
- Missing pieces that can't be replaced
- Underwear and socks that have seen better days

**Action:** Throw away. Don't donate things no one would want.

### Category 4: FIX (Worth Repairing)

**Criteria:**
- You love it AND would wear it if fixed
- The fix is worth the cost
- It's good quality worth investing in

**Action:** Set aside for tailor or repairs.

### Category 5: MAYBE (Uncertain)

**Criteria:**
- You're genuinely unsure
- Might need to try on or think about

**Action:** Box up, revisit in 30 days. If you didn't miss it, let it go.

## The Editing Process

### Step 1: Remove Everything

Yes, everything. Take every piece out of your closet and drawers.

This feels extreme but it's essential:
- You see the full scope of what you own
- You must actively choose to put items back
- It prevents the "I'll deal with that later" trap

Pile everything on your bed or floor.

### Step 2: Sort by Category

Group items:
- Tops (tees, blouses, sweaters)
- Bottoms (pants, jeans, skirts)
- Dresses
- Outerwear
- Shoes
- Accessories

Working through categories is more efficient than random evaluation.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Piece

Pick up each item and ask:

**Question 1: Does it fit RIGHT NOW?**
Not "when I lose weight." Not "when I gain weight." Now.
- If no → DONATE/SELL

**Question 2: Is it in good condition?**
Check for stains, holes, pilling, fading, stretching.
- If damaged and not worth fixing → TOSS
- If damaged and worth fixing → FIX

**Question 3: Have I worn it in the past year?**
Be honest. Check for dust, forgotten memories.
- If no, and you can't articulate why → DONATE/SELL
- If no, but it's for rare occasions and you need it → might KEEP

**Question 4: Do I feel good wearing it?**
Not just "okay." Good.
- If you hesitate → probably DONATE/SELL

**Question 5: Does it go with at least 3 other pieces I own?**
Orphan pieces that match nothing aren't earning their space.
- If no → DONATE/SELL (or identify what to add to make it work)

### Step 4: Handle the "Maybe" Pile

For pieces you can't decide on:

**Try it on.** Sometimes wearing something answers the question.

**Ask:** If I were shopping today, would I buy this?
- If no → DONATE/SELL

**Ask:** Have I thought about wearing this in the past month?
- If no → DONATE/SELL

If you're still unsure:
- Box it up with a date 30 days from now
- If you don't retrieve it in 30 days, donate without re-opening
- Seriously—don't re-open. Let it go.

### Step 5: Take Action Immediately

**KEEP pile:**
- Put back in closet
- Organize by category, then by color
- Take photos of pieces if helpful

**DONATE/SELL pile:**
- Bag or box immediately
- Put by the door or in your car
- Drop off within 48 hours (or it'll creep back into your closet)

**TOSS pile:**
- Into the trash now
- Don't second-guess

**FIX pile:**
- Note what each piece needs
- Schedule tailor visit or DIY repair time
- If it's been in the "fix" pile for 6+ months, probably DONATE/SELL

## What to Keep: Detailed Criteria

### KEEP If...

**It fits perfectly.** No alterations needed, comfortable all day.

**It's a workhorse.** You reach for it constantly because it works.

**It sparks genuine joy.** You love putting it on.

**It fills a specific role.** Your one blazer, your favorite jeans, your go-to dress.

**It's part of a formula.** It fits into your regular outfit combinations.

**It's quality worth preserving.** Good materials, good construction.

**It photographs well.** A weird test, but useful—things that look good in photos usually look good in life.

### KEEP With Caution If...

**You love it but never wear it.** Why not? Can that be fixed?

**It fit six months ago.** Is this temporary fluctuation or new normal?

**It's expensive.** Sunk cost shouldn't drive decisions, but premium pieces might deserve another chance.

**It's sentimental.** Consider keeping one or two truly meaningful pieces, but don't let sentiment override function.

## What to Let Go: Detailed Criteria

### DEFINITELY DONATE/SELL If...

**You forgot you owned it.** If it's not memorable, it's not essential.

**It doesn't fit.** Regardless of what it cost or the memory attached.

**You've never worn it.** Tags-on purchases are not going to suddenly become favorites.

**It's a duplicate.** You don't need 7 white tees if you only wear 2.

**It's "not you" anymore.** Your style has evolved. That's okay.

**It requires a lifestyle you don't have.** The gown for galas you don't attend. The ski wear when you don't ski.

**It only "works with" one thing.** Orphan pieces aren't earning their space.

**You wear it only because you "should."** Life is too short.

### DEFINITELY TOSS If...

**It's stained beyond saving.** Especially armpits, collars, crotch areas.

**It's torn beyond reasonable repair.** Small holes might be fixable; major tears probably aren't.

**It's stretched out.** Elastic that's gone is gone.

**It's significantly faded or pilled.** Some pilling is fixable; severe degradation isn't.

**It's expired.** Old sunscreen-stained swimsuits, stretched-out bras, worn-through socks.

## What to Fix: A Repair Guide

### Worth Fixing

**Hem adjustments:** $10-25. Always worth it for pieces you love.

**Taking in/letting out:** $15-40. Worth it for quality pieces.

**Button replacement:** $5-15. Easy fix for otherwise good items.

**Zipper replacement:** $15-30. Worth it for jackets, quality dresses.

**Small holes or tears:** $10-20. If the piece is otherwise solid.

**Professional cleaning:** $10-50. Can revive tired pieces.

### Probably Not Worth Fixing

**Major alterations exceeding half the garment's value.** Buy something that fits instead.

**Structural issues.** Seams coming apart throughout, fabric degrading.

**Alterations that change the garment's character.** If you need to change everything, you need a different piece.

**Cheap items.** $10 to fix a $15 shirt doesn't make sense.

### DIY Fixes

Simple repairs you can do yourself:

- Replace buttons
- Hem with iron-on tape
- Remove pills with a sweater shaver
- Remove stains with proper treatment
- Steam out wrinkles
- Sew simple seam repairs

YouTube has tutorials for all of these.

## After the Edit

### Reorganize Your Closet

With fewer pieces, organization becomes possible:

**By category:** All pants together, all blouses together
**By color within category:** Creates visual calm, makes coordination easy
**By frequency:** Most-worn items at eye level and easiest reach

### Note the Gaps

Your edit will reveal what's missing:

- "I have 10 tops but only 2 work pants"
- "All my casual shoes are worn out"
- "I don't have a single blazer that fits"

Write these gaps down. They're your strategic shopping list.

### Resist Immediate Shopping

Wait at least 2 weeks after your edit before buying anything.

Live with your edited closet. See how it functions. The "gaps" you identified might not feel like gaps once the clutter is gone.

### Maintain the Edit

A wardrobe edit isn't one-time. It's ongoing:

**Monthly:** Quick scan for items that aren't working
**Seasonally:** Rotate seasonal pieces, evaluate what you wore
**Annually:** Full comprehensive edit

The goal is to stay edited, not to edit once and let chaos return.

## Common Editing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Keeping "Just in Case" Items

"But what if I need it someday?"

You probably won't. And if you do, you can borrow, rent, or buy then.

**Fix:** If you haven't needed it in 2 years, you won't.

### Mistake 2: Keeping "Investment" Pieces You Don't Wear

"It was expensive, I can't just give it away."

The money is spent either way. Keeping it doesn't get the money back.

**Fix:** Sell it, donate it, or wear it. But don't let it take up space out of guilt.

### Mistake 3: Keeping "Goal" Clothes

"I'll wear this when I lose 10 pounds."

Those clothes make you feel bad every time you see them.

**Fix:** Dress your body now. Buy new pieces if/when your body changes.

### Mistake 4: Editing While Exhausted or Emotional

Bad headspace = bad decisions, in either direction.

**Fix:** Edit when you're calm, fed, and have time.

### Mistake 5: Not Actually Getting Rid of Things

Donate bags that sit in your house for months eventually get unpacked.

**Fix:** Remove edited items from your home within 48 hours.

## The Emotional Side

Letting go of clothes can feel surprisingly hard:

**Guilt:** "I spent money on this"
**Hope:** "Maybe I'll wear it someday"
**Memory:** "This reminds me of..."
**Identity:** "But this is who I was"

These feelings are valid. But clothes are not people. They're not memories. They're tools.

The memory stays even if the shirt goes. The money is spent either way. The person you're becoming deserves space.

Let go with gratitude: "Thank you for what you were. You're done now."

## The Reward

After a thorough edit, your closet transforms:

- You can see everything you own
- Everything fits and flatters
- Every piece works with others
- Getting dressed takes minutes
- You feel good in whatever you choose

That's not less clothing. That's more wardrobe—the version that actually functions.
